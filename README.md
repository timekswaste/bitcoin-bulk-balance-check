# Bi-t-coin Bulk Ba-lan-ce Che-ck Tool
A tool to check the address balance for multiple bitcoin addresses.

*To use it*  

  1. Create a file containing a javascript formatted array of addresses that you want to check.  
  `(example: ['address1','address2'])`

  2. Save it in the same directory as bitcoin-bulk-balance-check.js
	
  3. Update the filename on line 9 of bitcoin-bulk-balance-check.js with the filename with your filename.
	
  4. RUN: `npm install` from within the bitcoin-bulk-balance-check directory to configure the script
	
  5. RUN: `npm start` from within the bitcoin-bulk-balance-check directory to start the script


*Settings that can be changed*  

	var address_list_filename = 'burned.csv'; // REPLACE THIS FILENAME WITH YOUR FILENAME
	var save_to_file          = true; // save results to file
	var log_to_console        = true; // show results in console
	var delay_between_checks  = 0; // 1000 is one second
	var force_update_balance  = false; // true or false if you want it to grab balances for addresses that you've already checked before
	var exit_on_failure       = true; // true or false if you want the script to exit on a invalid response from the balance query


*Notice*  

blockchain.info has rate limits. Set the delay value above to the number in miliseconds to wait between each address balance check
